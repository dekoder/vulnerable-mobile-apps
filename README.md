## Vulnerable and Privacy Violating Mobile Apps

This project is a collection of mobile apps that demonstrate vulnerabilities and privacy violating behaviors.  They were created for the purpose of testing mobile application vetting tools.  The results of this study are found in this [report](https://github.com/mitre/vulnerable-mobile-apps/raw/master/analyzing-effectiveness-mobile-app-vetting-tools.pdf).  Presently, only Custom Class Loader and Device Admin Sample are available, but more to come shortly.  Make sure to watch the project if you want to be notified when the rest are uploaded.
